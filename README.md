## Description:

On Youtube I found a tutorial for a weather app. In this tutorial I learned to make an api call and how to use the data that was send form the api. With this app you can search the weather in almost every city or village. When searching for the weather the background will also change to an photo of the village or city you were searching for.

## How to use:

In the video weather-appMovie.mp4 you can see how the web-app should work. If you want to try it out by yourself you need to copy this repository and run it locally. This weather app works with two api's. For the weather api you need an api-key. Make an account on this website: (https://openweathermap.org/api). Add your api key in the script.js file and you're ready to try it out.

## Technologies:

The calculator is written in the code languages:
HTML, CSS and Javascript

## Feedback

This web-app was made with a tutorial from Jonah Lawrence â€¢ Dev Pro Tips. You can find it on: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZNG8UomjSI) This tutorial was very educative for me and in the future I will definitely use the unsplash api again.

Feel free to play around with it and if you have any feedback, let me know
Would be nice to learn from it.
